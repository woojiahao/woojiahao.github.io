Hi! I am Jia Hao and I am a software developer from Singapore. I graduated from Singapore Polytechnic with a Diploma in 
Information Technology. 

I am avid learner who loves solving complex and interesting problems. I seize every opportunity to hone my knowledge 
and seek to be a better version of myself everyday. My love for learning has been the primary motivating factor for me 
to learn programming as it is such a vast field. It has also cultivated my passion for teaching and helping others with
programming.

I started A Programmer's Perspective as a way for me to share about my journey into the belly of the beast 
(programming). A blog allowed me to combine my love for story-telling with my love for teaching and programming - 
killing three birds with one site!

## Currently, I'm learning ...

These are a list of the various topics that I'm learning at the moment. Check out my recommendations for books and 
videos [here!](https://www.notion.so/woojiahao/48b21a97d71c4cd2bc9a9051bd7423a3?v=e2c493015ceb47cfa275a03f20895cb1)

1. **Psychology** 

    I had thoroughly enjoyed learning about psychology through the "Introduction to Psychology" course on Coursera. So,
    I want to explore the field even more and to see if I would like to study it in depth in university as well! As
    such, I have decided to pick up a textbook on psychology, namely, the one available on OpenStax!

    The textbook can be found [here.](https://openstax.org/details/books/psychology)

2. **Elixir & Functional programming**

    Functional programming has always been an object of fascination for me (pun not intended). When programming in
    Kotlin, I have always tried to imitate basic functional programming concepts like creating pure functions and making
    full use of the "functions as first-class citizens" concept. However, I have never stepped out of this bubble and
    explored the other aspects of functional programming.

    Elixir is my jump into this rabbit hole. It was a language that was raved about in TPH and so I wanted to check out
    what the "fuss" was all about. I plan to learn Elixir and functional programming by exploring open source projects
    as I cannot really think of practical applications myself.

    The tutorial I am following can be found [here.](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html)

3. **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs**
   
   I have always been put off by this book due to its high level of technicality but now, I wanted to try something new 
   and so I decided to pick it up and give it a read. Currently, I'm enjoying it and really starting to put together the
   pieces of the book.

   The book can be found [here.](https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf)

## Hobbies

When I'm not programming, I enjoy running or hanging out with friends. I love reading and have been using my phone as an
e-book reader to consume various technical books on subjects spanning from CS to Math to Physics. I also spend my time 
on Discord as a moderator for the largest programming server on the platform where I socialise with my friends there (we 
generally goof off and have fun), discuss my project ideas with others, help beginners with programming problems, and 
handle any situations that may crop up among members.
