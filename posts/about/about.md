I am Jia Hao, a software developer from tiny red dot — Singapore! I am studying Computer Science at the National
University of Singapore! I use various technologies but my primary focus is in backend systems — managing databases and
building APIs.

I am avid learner who loves solving complex and interesting problems. I seize every opportunity to hone my knowledge
and seek to be a better version of myself everyday. My love for learning has been the primary motivating factor for me
to learn programming as it is such a vast field. It has also cultivated my passion for teaching and helping others with
programming.

I started A Programmer's Perspective as a way for me to share about my journey into the belly of the beast
(programming). A blog allowed me to combine my love for story-telling with my love for teaching and programming —
killing three birds with one site!

## Currently, I'm learning ...

These are a list of the various topics that I'm learning at the moment. Check out my recommendations for books and
videos [here!](https://www.notion.so/woojiahao/48b21a97d71c4cd2bc9a9051bd7423a3?v=e2c493015ceb47cfa275a03f20895cb1)

1. **Calculus**

    I am brushing up on my calculus using Thomas Calculus! I enjoy the depth that the textbook brings. Beyond just understanding formulas, I emphasize on understanding the proofs and theory behind each formula to lay a solid foundation!

    The book can be found [here.](https://www.amazon.com/Thomas-Calculus-14th-Joel-Hass/dp/0134438981)

2. **Elixir & Functional programming**

    Functional programming has always been an object of fascination for me (pun not intended). When programming in
    Kotlin, I have always tried to imitate basic functional programming concepts like creating pure functions and making
    full use of the "functions as first-class citizens" concept. However, I have never stepped out of this bubble and
    explored the other aspects of functional programming.

    Elixir is my jump into this rabbit hole. It was a language that was raved about in TPH and so I wanted to check out
    what the "fuss" was all about. I plan to learn Elixir and functional programming by exploring open source projects
    as I cannot really think of practical applications myself.

    The tutorial I am following can be found [here.](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html)

3. **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs**

   I have always been put off by this book due to its high level of technicality but now, I wanted to try something new
   and so I decided to pick it up and give it a read. Currently, I'm enjoying it and really starting to put together the
   pieces of the book.

   The book can be found [here.](https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf)

## Hobbies

When I'm not programming, I enjoy running or hanging out with friends. I love reading and have been using my phone as an
e-book reader to consume various technical books on subjects spanning from CS to Math to Physics.
