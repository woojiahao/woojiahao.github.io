I participated in the [Women in Data Science](http://www.widsconference.org/) conference hosted in Singapore at the Singapore University of Technology and Design. 	

I had thoroughly enjoyed myself during the conference. I was able to meet and listen to many empowering stories as well as observe how Data Science could be used in many many fields. 

I learnt more about image recognition as well as predicting a song's success using machine learning.
