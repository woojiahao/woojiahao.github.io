It has come to the point where I don't even know if the bookmarks I have created are\ntagged appropriately or they are just chucked into a random category.</p>\n<p>Last weekend, I was looking at some self-hosting open-source projects to dabble with for Open-source Deep Dive when I\nstumbled upon <a href=\"https://github.com/go-shiori/shiori/\">Shiori</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/archivy/archivy\">Archivy.</a> I\nthought to myself, \"wouldn't it be cool if I could take all of my bookmarks in Chrome and Trello and archive them for\nfuture reference?\" Naively, I exported my Chrome bookmarks and imported them into Shiori, only to realise that I was\narchiving the most obscure links ever. And then, I was hit with an epiphany - </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Would I even read these links? Or am I changing outfits for the same problem?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It really did seem like I was just trying to find fancier ways of putting off reading these articles. Even the creator\nof Shiori had a similar epiphany. In his issue addressing his departure from the project\n(<a href=\"https://github.com/go-shiori/shiori/issues/256\">here</a>), he stated that one of the reasons why he stopped working on\nShiori was because</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since long ago, I've got a habit to bookmark everything that looks interesting, even those that I haven't read.\nThanks to this, I have a huge amount of backlog of article that I haven't read. To fix this, now I use a private blog\nwhere I wrote interesting things that I've found from other articles. This way, I'm forced to read the article,\nbecause if I didn't read it properly, then I can't convey it in written form properly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"the-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel\" aria-label=\"the light at the end of the tunnel permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The light at the end of the tunnel</h2>\n<p>Reading that has made me realise that I would benefit more from this kind of reflective reading, rather than the\nmindless hoarding of these bookmarks. So, what I plan to do is to create a new blog just for these ramblings. Maybe I'll\npost them to a Notion page as a private catalogue and only siphon those that are <em>really</em> interesting into my\nrecommendations list or I can start a new blog project to manage the contents but that is yet to be confirmed.</p>\n<p>On top of that, I would like to become more active in writing this year so ideally, I would like to share my reflections\non an article I have read on this main blog every week. Other series like Open-source Deep Dive will still be in motion\nbut those require a lot more research and careful planning so they will be less frequent! I have also started reading a\nlot more technical books so I will be sharing my findings and learnings on those when I get the chance to!</p>\n<p>But for now, I would like to correct my bad habit of bookmark hoarding and begin taking more concrete steps towards\nbecoming a better developer/computer scientist in 2021!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Bookmark Apocalypse","date":"10 February 2021","description":"Reflection and resolution about hoarding bookmarks about articles and research papers","tags":["reflection","sharing","bookmarks","productivity"]},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/posts/the-bookmark-apocalypse"}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/posts/open-source-deep-dive-broadway-part-1"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Open-source Deep Dive: Broadway (Part 1) - Message queues, concurrency in Elixir, and Broadway architecture","published":true}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/posts/open-source-deep-dive-hound"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Open-source Deep Dive: Hound","published":true}}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/posts/the-bookmark-apocalypse","next":"/blog/posts/open-source-deep-dive-broadway-part-1","prev":"/blog/posts/open-source-deep-dive-hound"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2068778362","2207116114"]}
