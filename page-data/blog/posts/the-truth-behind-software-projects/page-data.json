You are one commit away from launching your first release of your latest idea. It's an AI system to help\npeople recommend names for their pets through pictures (clearly, Spot isn't a great name). You take a swig of coffee.\nYou fix the bug that has been sitting on the top of your Trello board for days now. <code class=\"language-text\">git add . &amp;&amp; git commit -am &quot;Fix\nissue where AI takes over the world&quot;</code> and you are off. Time to tag this release. This AI will be a hit and pet owners\nall around the globe can rejoice knowing that the arduous task of naming their pets will finally be over (now only if\nyou had an AI to recommend you variable names). You push the tag and head off to bed. Weeks go by and you continue\nworking on your revolutionary project. You add a feature that allows you to name pet rocks too. School starts. You get\nswept up with a sea of assignments and presentations. Soon, your baby starts to collect dust as you scramble to finish\nyour assignments. Eventually, school finishes and you heave a sigh of relief. \"Finally, I can add object naming too!\"\nyou think to yourself. But when you open up the project, you realise that the spark, that allure of the project is\ngone. You stare blankly at the Trello board of \"To-Do\" features and begin to see this project as a chore. Those new\nfeatures and promised rewrites now seem like a hassle. Those surges of dopamine you got every commit, now reduced to a\nmere flicker. But this can't happen, right? After all, this was your baby! You had spent an entire semester break\nbuilding it, raising it. It can't all be for nothing! What will happen to the poor pet owners?  You try convincing\nyourself that you can power through this lack of motivation. You think to yourself, \"Maybe if I just started here, I\nwould be able to find joy in working on this again\". But alas, no matter how hard you will yourself, you cannot find\nan ounce of motivation to fix that bug, to merge that pull request, to add that feature. You sigh and start questioning\nyourself. If you cannot finish a mere side project, are you even that worthy of being a developer?  But eventually, you\nfind another side project to occupy your time. One that makes your heart race every commit. And the cycle continues.</p>\n<p>What I had just shared is - what I believe - a common narrative many developers experience. In programming, we are\noften bombarded with the idea that side projects are a necessary staple of a developer - that one must have a Github\npage filled to the brim with open-source contributions and personal projects to be considered a good developer. But is\nit really necessary? Or are we - as a collective - creating unecessary barriers for ourselves. Is this mindset really\ngood for us? Or is it slowly destroying our motivation and sucking our weekends dry?</p>\n<p>In this post, I would like to explore this aspect of the industry and talk about my experiences working on side\nprojects and share some of my personal opinions on it. Now note, I do not claim to be a programming genius nor do I\nassume that my word is gospel. I am merely sharing my observations and experiences as a developer who was mostly\nself-taught. More importantly, this post is my way of performing introspection on my past five years as a developer and\nhow much I have grown since then.</p>\n<h2 id=\"separating-the-truth-from-fiction\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#separating-the-truth-from-fiction\" aria-label=\"separating the truth from fiction permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Separating the truth from fiction</h2>\n<p>As easy as it is to denounce the notion of side projects as a parasite to one's sanity. There are many truths and value\nthat can be derived from making side projets. So, I would first like to explain why I believe side projects are a\nuseful tool for developers.</p>\n<p>It is hard to deny that side projects can be incredibly fun to work on. When you find a project idea that you believe\nin, its siren's call is hard to resist. You'll find yourself spending hours on end on it. Your weekends can be\nengulfed by the pile of features you have planned for. </p>\n<p>When someone stars our repository. When Google Analytics reports a new user. When someone makes a pull request. When we\nget a new issue. It is an undeniable fact that seeing people use what we have built is incredibly rewarding and often\ntimes, that drives us to want to work on it more; we now have an audience of users that we cannot disappoint.</p>\n<p>Of course, many of us embark on side projects for the intrinsic rewards it presents to us. This fun is usually\nderived from the prospect of learning something new. Learning how a network protocol works. Learning how a language is\nused. Learning a new framework. These are all carrots-on-sticks for developers. Naturally curious, we all look for\nmental stimulation and seek the next idea we can get our fingers on. Side projects serve as a great way to explore\ndifferent technologies and collaborate with others.</p>\n<p>Side projects also offer a way for us, as developers, to view how much progress we have made. Remember that simple chat\napplication you made when you were 16? Now look at you creating web applications from scratch or learning a whole\nnetwork protocol on your own. These side projects document your journey as a developer and it is refreshing to look\nback and see how much you have grown through these projects.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-case-against-side-projects\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#a-case-against-side-projects\" aria-label=\"a case against side projects permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>A case against side projects</h2>\n<p>However, while the benefits of side projects are bountiful, it is hard to deny the \"downsides\" of side projects. Now, I\nuse the word downsides with <strong>heavy</strong> quotations as I do not believe that these are direct downsides of the idea of\nside projects itself. Rather, I believe that the downsides to side projects are derived from the value we have placed\non them as an industry and how we - as driven individuals - have warped this perception of a side project.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I believe that side projects are unnecessarily prized and emphasised. The naturally competitive environment in tech\nhas caused this idea that side projects are a quintessential component of any developer's arsenal to become overly\nemphasised.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is due to this over-emphasis that many who embark on side projects often develop feelings of guilts when they are\nunable to see a project through. It has caused the idea of side projects to transform from one of learning and\nexploration to one of a \"do-or-die\" nature. Worse still, those who do not devote time to side projects may feel as\nthough they are losing out against others and in turn develop an obsession with trying to \"catch up\" to them. This also\ndevalues the efforts of those who try at the beginning. I believe that this boils down to the fundamental behavior of\nhumans: competition. We will use any - and every - metric we can get our hands on to compare ourselves against one\nanother. This is also why I do not agree with those who try to micro-optimise their daily lives - trying to squeeze\nevery second that passes to achieve optimal productivity. I was one of those who were also obsessed with ensuring that\nmy every waking moment was meticulously planned to ensure that my productivity remained at its peak. This was born out\nof fear that the rapid advancements of this field would eventually overwhelm me and leave me in the lurch. However, the\nreality is, as much as it is important to be driven, we must recognise that there is more to life than an eternal grind\nto be productive. It is important that we look at the time we are spending on side projects objectively and questioning\nwhether we are neglecting other aspects of our life in pursuit of this \"grind\".</p>\n<p>This can lead to people developing an unhealthy obsession with creating side projects and working on that \"hustle\".\nWhile many feel incredibly motivated at the beginning, those who fail to properly pace themselves will end up burnt\nout. This can lead to a vicious cycle where they push themselves too hard only to feel exhausted, give up, and feel\nguilty about giving up - spurring them on to try even harder. Burn out - in tech - is one of the worst things that\ncould happen to a developer in my honest opinion. When one's livelihood depends on their ability to produce good code\nunder a time crunch, a general sense of demotivation can lead one to become careless; introducing bugs into their\nsystem. It also diminishes one's interest in the field and in the worst case, can drive them away from the field\nentirely.</p>\n<p>There are those who also pursue the idea of side projects with the incorrect mindset. Often when I speak to beginners,\nthey often state that they feel this obligation to start a side project because they have noticed that others are doing\nso. Some start this side project with the goal to become the number one starred repository on Github. Some dive into\none because they think that the only way to improve as a developer is to work on side projects. Some also get swept up\nwith the common myth that \"side projects == necessity to work in a company\" and end up pursuing this belief.</p>\n<p>However, what many of these individuals fail to realise is that side projects are not the only measure of a developer's\nworth. As alluring of an idea it is that a company will hire you if you have a portfolio the length of a PhD graduate,\ncompanies are often looking to hire those who demonstrate problem-solving abilities. So what if you have made 20 APIs\nbefore? If you fail to demonstrate the most fundamental skill a developer should possess, you won't be able to think\ncritically to solve new problems. While side projects <em>can</em> build problem-solving abilities, some may only venture\nwithin the range of their comfort zone to try new side projects. In some cases, this could mean never trying any\n\"hard problems\" as they do not believe that they possess the capacity to solve them on their own.</p>\n<p>It is this over-emphasis on side projects that has placed so much unnecessary pressure on new developers. I have met\nmany developers who have been wrapped in this worry that if they don't start building a spectacular portfolio right\nwhen they start, they will end up becoming a terrible developer. It is sad to see that they place this burden on\nthemsevles when learning to program should be a fun and enjoyable thing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-what-now\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#so-what-now\" aria-label=\"so what now permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>So what now?</h2>\n<p>In summary, I believe that side projects are not inherently evil. It is the warped perception of them that our industry\nhas created that has de-valued the true essence of them.</p>\n<p>I have been on both ends of the \"side project cycle\" before. I have been the naive developer who thought having\nhundreds of followers on Github or thousands of stars on my projects mattered and I have also been burnt out, swamped\nwith school work, and dissatisfied with my perceived notion of productivity. </p>\n<p>As with anything in life, the key is balance. Understanding that side projects are not - in any way - sole markers of a\ndeveloper's abilities is important. Having a large following on Github does not mean you are a terrific programmer and\nvice versa. Learning to appreciate the learning process, rather than working on something for the potential rewards, is\nan important aspect of life and moreso in this culture where developers often try to one-up one another with false\nmeasurements of success. In the end, what you work on should matter to you. You can build something to benefit others,\nI am not discouraging that, but you must bear in mind that at the end of the day, the one who benefits most from it\nshould be you.</p>\n<p>I think we have to look at each project objectively. \"Have I learnt something about myself, this technology, or\nprogramming in general?\" If yes, then I believe that you have already benefited greatly from it. Whether or not the\nproject is \"failed\" or \"incomplete\", as long as you have learnt something along the way, I do not believe that you\nshould belittle that effort.</p>\n<p>So go out and build something that inspires you! Work on the project that gets you excited. Explore technologies that\nyou are interested in. Don't worry so much about the perceived value of the project you are embarking on. This is YOUR\njourney, so enjoy it to the fullest! </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The truth behind software projects","date":"26 May 2020","description":"How I pick software projects and why I believe failed/incomplete projects are the best kind of projects","tags":["reflection","sharing"]},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/posts/the-truth-behind-software-projects"}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/posts/a-great-arrival"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A great arrival!","published":true}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/posts/deploying-a-discord-bot-written-with-kotlin-on-heroku"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Deploying discord bots written in Kotlin to Heroku","published":true}}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/posts/the-truth-behind-software-projects","next":"/blog/posts/a-great-arrival","prev":"/blog/posts/deploying-a-discord-bot-written-with-kotlin-on-heroku"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2068778362","2207116114"]}
