We were only tasked to make it work on the command line, <em>however</em>, I thought that it would not be fun at all since that kind of task would be rather mundane. Thus, I decided to add on some extra features to turn it into a fun project for me!</p>\n<h2>What did I do?</h2>\n<p>In order for this task to be more fun to do, I decided to give myself a couple of restrictions and challenges:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Complete the application in 24 hours </li>\n<li>Use SQLAlchemy to read and write to the database instead of traditional queries</li>\n<li>Actively use Git to checkpoint my progress</li>\n<li>Use TkInter to create a GUI to accompany this application</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What did I accomplish?</h2>\n<p>I managed to complete the application in around <strong>16 hours</strong>. </p>\n<p>I learnt a lot about TkInter and SQLAlchemy and ORMs in general. </p>\n<p>I became pretty proficient with using Git and thinking of better descriptions for each of my commits.</p>\n<p>Overall, I really enjoyed doing this challenge and it helped to reignite my coding high!</p>\n<h2>Learning points</h2>\n<h3>TkInter</h3>\n<p>As mentioned previously, I had learnt a lot about the built-in GUI library for Python, <a href=\"https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter\">TkInter</a>. I used the <a href=\"http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/\">TkInter tutorial book</a> on effbot.org. It had contained very concise and easy to understand explanations about the different widgets about TkInter.</p>\n<p>Using this knowledge, the few most major accomplishments using TkInter was:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Dynamically create frames that was used to display the edit column info in the <code class=\"language-text\">ConvertSetupWindow</code></li>\n<li>Changing between frames and effectively building GUIs</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>SQLAlchmey</h3>\n<p>Through continual application and reading up on the <em>very detailed</em> <a href=\"https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/\">documentation/reference</a> that SQLAlchemy has to offer! I learnt all about how an ORM can operate. </p>\n<p>Accomplishments using SQLAlchemy:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Dynamically generate tables using the handy <code class=\"language-text\">type(name, bases, dict)</code> function that allows me to create a table without knowing the exact details of the table at once.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"python\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-python line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-python\">attr_dict <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token string\">'__tablename__'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'Users'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> \n  <span class=\"token builtin\">id</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> Column<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>Integer<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> primary_key<span class=\"token operator\">=</span><span class=\"token boolean\">True</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  name <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> Column<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>String<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">50</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\ntable <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token builtin\">type</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'UsersTable'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>Base<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> attr_dict<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Insert multiple rows of data into a table without having to write a single line of SQL, greatly speeding up the process.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"python\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-python line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-python\">data <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'John Doe'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'Mary Anne'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">3</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'Peter Goh'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">with</span> engine<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>connect<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">as</span> conn<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">for</span> row <span class=\"token keyword\">in</span> data<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>\n    ins <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> tbl<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>insert<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>values<span class=\"token operator\">=</span>row<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    conn<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>execute<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>ins<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<h3>Python</h3>\n<p>I also learnt a lot about the Python language and what it takes to write good code. I also managed to apply some fancy boolean algebra in my code to check if any checkboxes were selected. I also thought a method of finding out whether a combination of columns would be eligible as a Primary Key in the database! These were all things that I would have never thought about if not for this project.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I really enjoyed making this project as it had not only helped me reignite my joy for coding, but also, provide me with valuable insight about Python and ORMs and it has made me appreciate how ORMs handle the heavy lifting for the users.</p>\n<p>The repository is currently made private, however, once my assignment is over, I will be including the URL for it!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Crafting a CSV to DB tool","date":"15 July 2018","description":null},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/posts/2018-07-15-making-a-csv-to-database-tool"}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/posts/2018-07-12-Deploying-a-Kotlin-bot-on-discord-with-heroku"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Deploying Discord bots written in Kotlin on Heroku","published":true}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/posts/2018-10-06-Introduction-to-Kotlin-workshop"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Experience conducting a workshop for Kotlin","published":true}}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/posts/2018-07-15-making-a-csv-to-database-tool","next":"/blog/posts/2018-10-06-Introduction-to-Kotlin-workshop","prev":"/blog/posts/2018-07-12-Deploying-a-Kotlin-bot-on-discord-with-heroku"}}}
