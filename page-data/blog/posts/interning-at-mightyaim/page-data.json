When I joined, I was assigned to complete the basic Android framework. There was no one on the Android team, so I was left to my own vices to create this framework.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-good\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-good\" aria-label=\"the good permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Good</h2>\n<p>I really enjoyed working for MightyAim, it was a fun experience and I got to learn a lot about programming and Android development, specifically, making custom gestures and understanding fragments. It had taught me a lot about being an effective developer, as well as learning to cherish teammates since there was no one else on the team to help me out.</p>\n<p>However, in that same regard, I learnt to become more independant. Rather than relying on others all the time, I had to figure everything out from scratch. And that had really made me feel a greater sense of accomplishment.</p>\n<p>The boss was also very accepting and had a very flexible working schedule and this made it tremendously easy to voice any concerns with the framework and it allowed me to be a lot more relaxed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-bad\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-bad\" aria-label=\"the bad permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Bad</h2>\n<p>There were some points because I had no one else to rely on, it made it difficult to find solutions to problems. This has most definitely made me experience Imposter's Syndrome as I was stuck in this rut that I couldn't get out of and continually felt that I wasn't good enough.</p>\n<p>However, when I took a step back, tried doing other things before coming back to the problem at hand, and I was able to think of better, more efficient solutions to the same problem.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-ugly-well-sort-of\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-ugly-well-sort-of\" aria-label=\"the ugly well sort of permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Ugly (well, sort of...)</h2>\n<p>Whilst there were plenty of good things about working at MightyAim, like most companies, there will be flaws. The biggest one I had observed was the lack of proper organization I felt was present when first tasked to make the framework. Many of the decisions previously made seemed impromptu.</p>\n<p>However, airing my concerns with the boss had most definitely enabled me to keep on track.</p>\n<h2 id=\"overall\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#overall\" aria-label=\"overall permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Overall</h2>\n<p>In conclusion, I enjoyed my first internship (as well as my first job ever) at MightyAim. It was a terrific learning experience and they have a genuine mission which I truly believe is worth any effort and struggle I had put in.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Interning at MightyAim - the good, the bad and the ugly","date":"14 April 2018","description":null,"tags":["internship","visually impaired","Android development","reflection"]},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/posts/interning-at-mightyaim"}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/posts/learning-about-kml"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Breaking down KML files","published":true}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/posts/women-in-data-science"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Attending Women in Data Science event","published":true}}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/posts/interning-at-mightyaim","next":"/blog/posts/learning-about-kml","prev":"/blog/posts/women-in-data-science"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2068778362","2207116114"]}
