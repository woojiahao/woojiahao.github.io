Over the past 5 months, I was in that slump. Even though school work had swamped me, it was\nnever challenging, rather, just a lot of work to handle. This lack of a challenge had made me begin to feel that I\nwasn't growing as a developer.</p>\n<h3 id=\"introducing-omnius\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#introducing-omnius\" aria-label=\"introducing omnius permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Introducing Omnius</h3>\n<p>During the holidays, I dug through the pile of project ideas I had, and I noticed one idea had stood out to me:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A Markdown Editor</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It was such a simple concept and yet it was something I was in need of because maintaining a blog in an editor like\nVisual Studio Code, whilst workable, never felt seamless <strong>and</strong> I also begun taking notes in markdown, and the\nlack of customization that the Markdown to PDF extension Visual Studio Code had was insufficient. As such, I embarked\non my journey to write my own markdown editor.</p>\n<p>I've begun working on it and it's proven to be a lot more challenging than I expected and that's incredibly refreshing!</p>\n<p><img src=\"../assets/img/Omnius_Preview.png\" alt=\"\">\nFigure 1: Preview of Omnius</p>\n<h3 id=\"technology-stack\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#technology-stack\" aria-label=\"technology stack permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Technology Stack</h3>\n<p>For this project, I'll be using the following technologies:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Kotlin</li>\n<li>TornadoFX</li>\n<li>RichTextFX</li>\n<li>FontAwesomeFX</li>\n<li>Reactive (?)</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-label=\"conclusion permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>This is just a short post about where I'm at and I'm incredibly excited to have a project that I'm genuinely interested\nin and learning from!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Introducing Omnius","date":"24 February 2019","description":"Introducing Omnius - a markdown editor built with Kotlin and TornadoFX","tags":["Omnius","TornadoFX","Kotlin","JavaFX","markdown","editor","MVC"]},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/posts/introducing-omnius"}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/posts/national-data-science-challenge-2019"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Concluding the National Data Science Challenge 2019","published":true}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/posts/writing-a-wrapper"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Writing a wrapper","published":true}}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/posts/introducing-omnius","next":"/blog/posts/national-data-science-challenge-2019","prev":"/blog/posts/writing-a-wrapper"}},
