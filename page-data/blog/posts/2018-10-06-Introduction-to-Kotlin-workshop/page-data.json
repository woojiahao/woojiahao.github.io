This was an incredibly interesting and refreshing experience,\ngetting to see Year 1 students learning about a language I was passionate about learning myself.</p>\n<h2>Planning the workshop</h2>\n<p>The most difficult part about the talk was to convey my knowledge in the subject to a group of relatively new\nprogrammers. This made it especially interesting as I did not want to just feed them knowledge whilst they stare\nblankly at me, so in the end, I came up with a sample project for them to follow along as well as made use of a set of\ndocumentation sites for anyone else who was interested in the tutorial to just follow along.</p>\n<h2>KotlinToDo</h2>\n<p>In the end, the final idea that I came up with was to simply have the audience follow along as I created a simple to-do\napplication for Android which had the ability to connect to Firebase's real-time database and serve information to the\nuser.</p>\n<p>This project, whilst being relatively simple, really seemed like a good way to introduce beginners to not only Kotlin\nbut also fundamental software design concepts that they might have missed in class.</p>\n<p>The project came along with a set of elaborate documentation that I had spent weeks working on in order to ensure they\nwere easy to work with.</p>\n<h2>Difficulties encountered</h2>\n<p>When it came to the actual talk, the biggest hurdle that I did not anticipate to run into was simply the difference in\nlevel of experience amongst the audience. Some members were new programmers who only just begun 6 months ago, whilst\nothers had 18 years of experience. This made it so when I was explaining various concepts, I always had to keep in the\nback of my mind whether the way I explained the concept was easily understood by the beginners and did not bore the\nmore experienced individuals.</p>\n<p>This was a unique problem I had faced as it was the first time I was teaching such a large group of people and it was\nmost certainly something I had little to no experience in. Going through this talk really taught me how to articulate\nmy thoughts and to deliver the concepts I had in my head to others out loud.</p>\n<h2>Rewarding</h2>\n<p>We did not manage to cover everything I had intended to go through, but at the end of the day, it was really about\nencouraging these attendees to be inquisitive and to enjoy the process of software development, which is something I\nenjoy a lot.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, I felt happy that I managed to pull off such a workshop as my first time and I am incredibly\ngrateful to my lecturers and the attendees for signing up and sitting through this off discovery of mine.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Overall, this workshop was an eye-opening experience and it really made me develop a much greater sense of appreciation\nfor the lecturers of my school as I have never experienced what they might experience teaching everyday to even larger\naudiences. </p>\n<p>I also managed to grow a lot both as an individual, as I honed my communication skills and teaching abilities.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in following along the workshop materials and making your own version of KotlinToDo, you can feel\nfree to do so by following the documentation site <a href=\"https://woojiahao.github.io/KotlinToDo\">here.</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Experience conducting a workshop for Kotlin","date":"06 October 2018"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/posts/2018-10-06-Introduction-to-Kotlin-workshop"}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/posts/2018-07-15-making-a-csv-to-database-tool"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Crafting a CSV to DB tool","published":true}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/posts/2018-10-28-Kotlin-And-Lambdas"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Familiarising yourself with lambdas in Kotlin","published":true}}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/posts/2018-10-06-Introduction-to-Kotlin-workshop","next":"/blog/posts/2018-10-28-Kotlin-And-Lambdas","prev":"/blog/posts/2018-07-15-making-a-csv-to-database-tool"}}}
