You don't need to travel across the globe because you\nbelieve that, somehow, by moving away, you will attain the happiness and success you so desire. You don't need to be\nthe top of your class to be successful or well-liked.</p>\n<p>As simple as that seems, you always forget about them. You started with nothing and clawed your way to where you are\ntoday without all these fanciful things. You come from a lower-middle income family. You grew up with little luxaries;\nYou never got the latest games or watched the latest movies. You never went to an elite primary school, secondary\nschool, or polytechnic. Even after getting an amazing score for your O'Levels, you still chose to attend a polytechnic\nto pursue your love for programming. You have never been one to trod along the well-worn path. You have been following\nyour own yellow brick road. Why are you hesitating now? Why are you trying to rush your future? Why are you comparing\nyourself to others?</p>\n<p>Do things because you want to, not because you believe that somehow they will lead you to success. I believe that you\nneed a constant reminder for what your goals are because when you worry too much, you begin to fallback on common\nstereotypes and fail to find the meaning behind your actions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You want to attend a <strong>good</strong> school because you want to discover yourself as a person and to be amongst like-minded\nindividuals to you can share your passions with. The brand of the school is not as important as the experiences you\nchoose to be a part of. You will naturally find yourself amongst friends who share common interests, so do not worry\nabout where you end up. Rather, focus on what you make out of your time there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You want to <strong>travel</strong> because you know that experiencing different cultures will allow you to better understand\nothers and develop your outlook on life. The destination, duration, or purpose may vary, but the one thing that\ncannot change is this openness to new experiences.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You want to be the <strong>top</strong> of your class because you genuinely love what you are studying and will achieve these\nresults because you are studying something out of passion. Your love for learning has always spurred you to go above\nand beyond, do not let this never-ending hunger for knowledge be a hindrance. Rather, let it be your guiding light -\na constant reminder of why you are doing what you are doing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You managed to reach where you are today because you genuinely loved the process of learning and growing, so why stop\nnow? You managed to carve out your brand of success by persisting through hard times. Ironically, it was because of\nthese conditions that you are who you are today, and that makes you so special.</p>\n<p>Rather than trying to look at everything in a negative light, focus on the positives of each outcome. Pessimism is the\nticket to regret. Do not live life with regrets.</p>\n<p>Rather than being fixated on the vague end goal, set out to achieve it. It is your life, your decisions, and your\nfuture. It is not up to someone else to mandate whether you are successful or not. It is easy to conflate academic\nsuccess or material wealth with success in today's society. But these notions of success are never-ending. You will\nnever be happy trying to pursue these vague ideas of success. Instead, turn these ideas of success into guidelines to\ncharting your own success. Do well because you enjoy what you are studying and love the process of learning. Earn\nenough so that you are able to survive but do not fall into the never-ending cycle of pursuing wealth for the sake of\npursuing wealth. The endless pursuit of wealth is one that will suck the life out of anyone brave - or foolish - enough\nto venture down this path.</p>\n<p>When you start to focus on the true meaning behind your decisions, you will be able to naturally achieve them.</p>\n<p>You already know all of these. I know that deep down, you have never faltered in your goals and ambitions. You may get\nlost and fumble at times, but I believe that your pursuit to understand the world around you and be a good person is\nnever lost, only clouded by the circumstances presented to you. So, why are you still doubting yourself? You have\nproven that you do not need to be dealt the perfect hand to win the game. So go out there, pursue what you love, be\nfocused, do not waver in your conviction, and you will attain your brand of happiness - one that comes from being your\ntrue self to others and to yourself. Who cares whether your yellow brick road has detours or bumps and\nimperfections? At the end of your journey, look back and smile knowing that it is through this yellow brick road that\nyou are who you are today.</p>\n<p>So please, stop doubting yourself and second-guessing every decision you make, you will be happy, no matter where you\nland because happiness comes from within, not your circumstances.</p>\n<p><em>Regards, Jia Hao</em></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The yellow brick road of life","date":"15 July 2020","description":"A reminder to myself to stop worrying about the future and focus on the present","tags":["reflection","sharing","motivation"]},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/posts/the-yellow-brick-road-of-life"}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/posts/a-great-arrival"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A great arrival!","published":true}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/blog/posts/discovering-chrome-accounts"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Discovering Chrome accounts","published":true}}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/posts/the-yellow-brick-road-of-life","next":"/blog/posts/discovering-chrome-accounts","prev":"/blog/posts/a-great-arrival"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2068778362","2207116114"]}
