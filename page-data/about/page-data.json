I recently graduated from Singapore Polytechnic with a Diploma in Information\nTechnology. I am avid learner and love problem-solving. I seize every opportunity to hone my knowledge and seek to be\na better version of myself everyday.</p>\n<p>I started A Programmer's Perspective as a way for me to share about my journey into the belly of the beast\n(programming). A blog allowed me to combine my love for story-telling with my love for teaching and programming -\nkilling three birds with one site!</p>\n<h2>Experience</h2>\n<h3>Working experience</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Android developer @ <a href=\"https://www.mightyaim.co/\">MightyAim</a> - Feb 2018 to May 2018</p>\n<p>During my time at MightyAim, I was posted as the sole Android developer in the team - tasked with creating an Android\nframework for other developers to supercharge their applications to become accessible to the visually impaired. I set\nthe foundations for the direction of the framework - for both Android and iOS and built the core codebase that would\nserve as the base for expansions. I picked up skills such as Android development and UI design as well as learning to\ninteract with clients and pitching my ideas to the team.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Intern - SOI Re-platform @ <a href=\"https://www.dbs.com.sg/index/default.page\">DBS Singapore</a> - Apr 2019 to Aug 2019</p>\n<p>I wore many hats during my internship at DBS Singapore - serving as a UAT team coordinator, automating workflows,\nperforming data mining &#x26; analysis, creating and managing quality management checks, and administering the project\nJIRA board. </p>\n<p>Throughout my time at DBS, I have interacted with many stakeholders across 96 teams (just in Singapore) and built\nconnections with countless members of various teams. I have developed my soft skills significantly during this period\nand have become proficient at communicating my ideas and understanding technical and business needs from each team. I\nhave also learnt a great deal about Linux commands, TIBCO designer, and monolith infrastructure as the project\ninvolves changes to the entire bank's infrastructure. Being a part of such a big project has been an honour and I\nenjoyed every second of it.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Programming languages</h3>\n<p>I am most proficient in Kotlin, Javascript, and SQL. </p>\n<p>I have experience in other languages like C#, Java, and Python.</p>\n<p>I recently started using Go, such as making a <a href=\"/projects/posts/torrent.go\">BitTorrent protocol implementation</a> and\n<a href=\"/projects/posts/govid-19\">COVID-19 statistic API.</a></p>\n<h3>Technologies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Linux</li>\n<li>Heroku</li>\n<li>Docker</li>\n<li>Git</li>\n<li>Gatsby.js</li>\n<li>Vue</li>\n<li>Spring Boot</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Projects</h2>\n<p>Some of my notable projects are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"/projects/posts/torrent.go\"><strong>torrent.go</strong></a> - BitTorrent protocol implementation</li>\n<li><a href=\"/projects/posts/govid-19\"><strong>govid-19</strong></a> - COVID-19 statistics API</li>\n<li><a href=\"/projects/posts/kMD2PDF\"><strong>kMD2PDF</strong></a> - Markdown to PDF file conversion library written in Kotlin</li>\n<li><a href=\"/projects/posts/Taiga\"><strong>Taiga</strong></a> - Discord administration bot written in Kotlin</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A comprehensive list of all my projects can be found <a href=\"/projects\">here.</a></p>\n<h2>Currently, I'm learning ...</h2>\n<p>These are a list of the various topics that I'm learning at the moment.

I have always\nbeen keen on learning about psychology and the course on Coursera seemed like the perfect gateway for me! </p>\n<p>I am also using this opportunity to learn how university classes are organised and to get familiar with the rigour\nof it.</p>\n<p>The course can be found <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-psychology\">here.</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</strong></p>\n<p>I have always been put off by this book due to its high level of technicality but now, I wanted to try something new\nand so I decided to pick it up and give it a read.
