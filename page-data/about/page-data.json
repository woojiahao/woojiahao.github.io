I am a third year student at Singapore Polytechnic, pursuing a Diploma in\nInformation &#x26; Technology under the School of Technology. I am avid learner and love problem solving. I seize any\nopportunity to hone my knowledge and seek to be the best at anything I set my sights on.</p>\n<p>Currently, I am having my semester break and I'm working on several projects and learning some CS related topics.</p>\n<p>I was a former intern at DBS Singapore, where I made the following contributions to my project - SOI\nRe-platform:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>UAT team coordinator - went from 96 teams pending testing to 9 teams pending!</li>\n<li>Workflow automation - applied Java &#x26; Python skills to automate tasks that would take hours to complete to have them\ncompleted within minutes</li>\n<li>Data mining &#x26; investigation - used my understanding of data mining and data file types to sieve through large sets of\ndata to analyse patterns and provide accurate reporting</li>\n<li>Quality management - new area explored and picked up invaluable skills in picking out issues from production and\nlogging them to ensure future releases are not messed up</li>\n<li>JIRA administrator - learnt JIRA while on the job and became proficient with various tools and workflows within JIRA\nsuch as bulk creating test cases and managing sprints</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Experience</h2>\n<h3>Programming languages</h3>\n<p>I am proficient in Kotlin, Java, Python and SQL. I have dabbled in other languages such as Javascript and C# in the past\nbut I have never really went into any major projects with those languages. However, I intend to delve into the world of\nweb development and explore the various frameworks and tools used in the industry.</p>\n<h3>Working experience</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Android developer @ <a href=\"https://www.mightyaim.co/\">MightyAim</a> - Feb 2018 to May 2018</p>\n<p>During my time at MightyAim, I was posted as the sole Android developer in the team - tasked with creating an Android\nframework for other developers to supercharge their applications to become accessible to the visually impaired. I set\nthe foundations for the direction of the framework - for both Android and iOS and built the core codebase that would\nserve as the base for expansions. I picked up skills such as Android development and UI design as well as learning to\ninteract with clients and pitching my ideas to the team.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Intern - SOI Re-platform @ <a href=\"https://www.dbs.com.sg/index/default.page\">DBS Singapore</a> - Apr 2019 to Aug 2019</p>\n<p>As explained earlier, I wore many hats during my internship at DBS Singapore, serving as a UAT team coordinator,\nautomating workflows, performing data mining &#x26; analysis, creating and managing quality management checks as well as\nadministering the project JIRA board. Throughout my stay at DBS, I have interacted with over thousands of stakeholders\nacross 96 teams (just in Singapore) and built connections with countless members of various teams. I have developed my\nsoft skills significantly during this period and have become proficient at communicating my ideas and understanding\ntechnical and business needs from each team. I have also learnt a great deal about Linux commands, TIBCO designer and\nmonolith infrastructure as the project involves changes to the entire bank's infrastructure. Being a part of such a big project\nhas been an honour and I enjoyed every second of it.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Projects</h2>\n<p>Some of my projects include</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>kMD2PDF</strong> - Markdown to PDF file conversion library written in Kotlin; link <a href=\"https://github.com/omnius-project/kMD2PDF\">here</a></li>\n<li><strong>Omnius</strong> - Markdown IDE written in Kotlin; link <a href=\"https://github.com/omnius-project/Omnius\">here</a></li>\n<li><strong>Taiga</strong> - Discord administration bot written in Kotlin; link <a href=\"https://github.com/woojiahao/Taiga\">here</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Currently, I'm learning ...</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Algebra and trigonometry</strong> </p>\n<p>I am currently revising algebra and trigonometry as I'm planning to go into more complex math soon and begin picking\nup algorithm analysis. Revising algebra and trigonometry is also part of my preparation for the SATs.</p>\n<p>I am using the <a href=\"https://openstax.org/details/books/algebra-and-trigonometry\">OpenStax textbook</a> to learn this\nsubject.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Struture and Interpretation of Computer Programs</strong></p>\n<p>I have always been put off by this book due to its high level of technicality but this holiday, I really wanted to try something new and so I decided to pick it up and give it a read. Currently, I'm enjoying it and really starting to put together the pieces of the book.</p>\n<p>The book can be found <a href=\"https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf\">here.</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Hobbies</h2>\n<p>When I'm not programming, I can be seen running or hanging out with friends. I also love reading and have been using my\nphone as an e-book reader to consume various technical books on subjects spanning from CS to Math to Physics.
