I seize every opportunity to hone my knowledge\nand seek to be a better version of myself everyday.

I set\nthe foundations for the direction of the framework - for both Android and iOS and built the core codebase that would\nserve as the base for expansions. I picked up skills such as Android development and UI design as well as learning to\ninteract with clients and pitching my ideas to the team.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Intern - SOI Re-platform @ <a href=\"https://www.dbs.com.sg/index/default.page\">DBS Singapore</a> - Apr 2019 to Aug 2019</p>\n<p>I wore many hats during my internship at DBS Singapore - serving as a UAT team coordinator, automating workflows,\nperforming data mining &#x26; analysis, creating and managing quality management checks, and administering the project\nJIRA board. </p>\n<p>Throughout my time at DBS, I have interacted with many stakeholders across 96 teams (just in Singapore) and built\nconnections with countless members of various teams. I have developed my soft skills significantly during this period\nand have become proficient at communicating my ideas and understanding technical and business needs from each team. I\nhave also learnt a great deal about Linux commands, TIBCO designer, and monolith infrastructure as the project\ninvolves changes to the entire bank's infrastructure. Being a part of such a big project has been an honour and I\nenjoyed every second of it.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"programming-languages\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#programming-languages\" aria-label=\"programming languages permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Programming languages</h3>\n<p>I am most proficient in Kotlin, Javascript, and SQL. </p>\n<p>I have experience in other languages like C#, Java, and Python.</p>\n<p>I recently started using Go, such as making a <a href=\"/projects/posts/torrent.go\">BitTorrent protocol implementation</a> and\n<a href=\"/projects/posts/govid-19\">COVID-19 statistic API.</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"technologies\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#technologies\" aria-label=\"technologies permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Technologies</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Linux</li>\n<li>Heroku</li>\n<li>Docker</li>\n<li>Git</li>\n<li>Gatsby.js</li>\n<li>Vue</li>\n<li>Spring Boot</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"projects\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#projects\" aria-label=\"projects permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Projects</h2>\n<p>Some of my notable projects are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"/projects/posts/go-http-server\"><strong>go-http-server</strong></a> - HTTP server written from scratch in Go</li>\n<li><a href=\"/projects/posts/git-guide\"><strong>Git Guide</strong></a> - Introduction to the Git version control system for Singapore Polytechnic\nSoftware Engineering Practices module</li>\n<li><a href=\"/projects/posts/torrent.go\"><strong>torrent.go</strong></a> - BitTorrent protocol implementation</li>\n<li><a href=\"/projects/posts/govid-19\"><strong>govid-19</strong></a> - COVID-19 statistics API</li>\n<li><a href=\"/projects/posts/kMD2PDF\"><strong>kMD2PDF</strong></a> - Markdown to PDF file conversion library written in Kotlin</li>\n<li><a href=\"/projects/posts/Taiga\"><strong>Taiga</strong></a> - Discord administration bot written in Kotlin</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A comprehensive list of all my projects can be found <a href=\"/projects\">here.</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"currently-im-learning-\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#currently-im-learning-\" aria-label=\"currently im learning  permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Currently, I'm learning ...</h2>\n<p>These are a list of the various topics that I'm learning at the moment. Check out my recommendations for books and\nvideos <a href=\"/recommendations\">here!</a></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Psychology</strong> </p>\n<p>I had thoroughly enjoyed learning about psychology through the \"Introduction to Psychology\" course on Coursera. So,\nI want to explore the field even more and to see if I would like to study it in depth in university as well! As\nsuch, I have decided to pick up a textbook on psychology, namely, the one available on OpenStax!</p>\n<p>The textbook can be found <a href=\"https://openstax.org/details/books/psychology\">here.</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Elixir &#x26; Functional programming</strong></p>\n<p>Functional programming has always been an object of fascination for me (pun not intended). When programming in\nKotlin, I have always tried to imitate basic functional programming concepts like creating pure functions and making\nfull use of the \"functions as first-class citizens\" concept. However, I have never stepped out of this bubble and\nexplored the other aspects of functional programming.</p>\n<p>Elixir is my jump into this rabbit hole. It was a language that was raved about in TPH and so I wanted to check out\nwhat the \"fuss\" was all about. I plan to learn Elixir and functional programming by exploring open source projects\nas I cannot really think of practical applications myself.</p>\n<p>The tutorial I am following can be found <a href=\"https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html\">here.</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</strong></p>\n<p>I have always been put off by this book due to its high level of technicality but now, I wanted to try something new\nand so I decided to pick it up and give it a read. Currently, I'm enjoying it and really starting to put together the\npieces of the book.</p>\n<p>The book can be found <a href=\"https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf\">here.</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"hobbies\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#hobbies\" aria-label=\"hobbies permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Hobbies</h2>\n<p>When I'm not programming, I enjoy running or hanging out with friends. I love reading and have been using my phone as an\ne-book reader to consume various technical books on subjects spanning from CS to Math to Physics. I also spend my time\non Discord as a moderator for the largest programming server on the platform where I socialise with my friends there (we\ngenerally goof off and have fun), discuss my project ideas with others, help beginners with programming problems, and\nhandle any situations that may crop up among members.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/about","title":"About Me"}}}
