# Personal Website

> Jia Hao's the name. Simplicity's the game.

## Why the redesign?

I have decided that maintaining and adding new features to the previous Gatsby.js website
was too time consuming and took away from my ability to work on my other projects and 
write better and more detailed articles.

## What has changed?

I have redesigned my primary site (woojiahao.com) to be a simple HTML + CSS page that
contains my portfolio.

I have moved my blog to a [separate repository](https://github.com/woojiahao/blog) and 
used Hugo instead. This way, I don't need to spend time deliberating over designs and 
implmenting complex features on my own.

## Where is the old site?

I have kept it as the original branch `develop`. The new branch you are on, `latest`,
houses the most recent set of changes.
