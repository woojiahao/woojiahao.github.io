I am a software developer from Singapore. I recently graduated from Singapore Polytechnic with a Diploma in Information 
Technology. I am avid learner and love problem-solving. I seize every opportunity to hone my knowledge and seek to be
a better version of myself everyday.

I started A Programmer's Perspective as a way for me to share about my journey into the belly of the beast 
(programming). A blog allowed me to combine my love for story-telling with my love for teaching and programming - 
killing three birds with one site!

## Experience

### Working experience

- Android developer @ [MightyAim](https://www.mightyaim.co/) - Feb 2018 to May 2018
  
  During my time at MightyAim, I was posted as the sole Android developer in the team - tasked with creating an Android 
  framework for other developers to supercharge their applications to become accessible to the visually impaired. I set
  the foundations for the direction of the framework - for both Android and iOS and built the core codebase that would
  serve as the base for expansions. I picked up skills such as Android development and UI design as well as learning to
  interact with clients and pitching my ideas to the team.

- Intern - SOI Re-platform @ [DBS Singapore](https://www.dbs.com.sg/index/default.page) - Apr 2019 to Aug 2019

  I wore many hats during my internship at DBS Singapore - serving as a UAT team coordinator, automating workflows, 
  performing data mining & analysis, creating and managing quality management checks, and administering the project 
  JIRA board. 
  
  Throughout my time at DBS, I have interacted with many stakeholders across 96 teams (just in Singapore) and built 
  connections with countless members of various teams. I have developed my soft skills significantly during this period 
  and have become proficient at communicating my ideas and understanding technical and business needs from each team. I 
  have also learnt a great deal about Linux commands, TIBCO designer, and monolith infrastructure as the project 
  involves changes to the entire bank's infrastructure. Being a part of such a big project has been an honour and I 
  enjoyed every second of it.

### Programming languages

I am most proficient in Kotlin, Javascript, and SQL. 

I have experience in other languages like C#, Java, and Python.

I recently started using Go, such as making a [BitTorrent protocol implementation](/projects/posts/torrent.go) and 
[COVID-19 statistic API.](/projects/posts/govid-19)

### Technologies

- Linux
- Heroku
- Docker
- Git
- Gatsby.js
- Vue
- Spring Boot

## Projects

Some of my notable projects are:

1. [**torrent.go**](/projects/posts/torrent.go) - BitTorrent protocol implementation
2. [**govid-19**](/projects/posts/govid-19) - COVID-19 statistics API
3. [**kMD2PDF**](/projects/posts/kMD2PDF) - Markdown to PDF file conversion library written in Kotlin
4. [**Taiga**](/projects/posts/Taiga) - Discord administration bot written in Kotlin

## Currently, I'm learning ...

These are a list of the various topics that I'm learning at the moment. Check out my recommendations for books and 
videos [here!](/recommendations)

1. **Introduction to Psychology** 
    
   Making use of the COVID-19 period, I have decided to embark on a journey to learn about psychology. I have always 
   been keen on learning about psychology and the course on Coursera seemed like the perfect gateway for me! 
   
   I am also using this opportunity to learn how university classes are organised and to get familiar with the rigour 
   of it.
   
   The course can be found [here.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-psychology)
   
2. **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs**
   
   I have always been put off by this book due to its high level of technicality but now, I wanted to try something new 
   and so I decided to pick it up and give it a read. Currently, I'm enjoying it and really starting to put together the
   pieces of the book.

   The book can be found [here.](https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf)

## Hobbies

When I'm not programming, I enjoy running or hanging out with friends. I love reading and have been using my phone as an
e-book reader to consume various technical books on subjects spanning from CS to Math to Physics.
