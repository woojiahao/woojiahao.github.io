I am writing a really short blog post to share about my most recent discovery - Chrome user accounts! I never really
experimented with them until now but they came as a pleasant surprise. They work as autonomous sessions of Chrome that
store different bookmarks and can have different pages open at once. It is amazing for productivity as it allows me to
have different tabs open for different accounts so that my main session isn't cluttered with tabs I will rarely ever 
read!

What a find!
