Every developer will encounter slumps where they have no idea what to do and nothing in their life challenges them
to grow as a developer. Over the past 5 months, I was in that slump. Even though school work had swamped me, it was
never challenging, rather, just a lot of work to handle. This lack of a challenge had made me begin to feel that I 
wasn't growing as a developer. 

### Introducing Omnius
During the holidays, I dug through the pile of project ideas I had, and I noticed one idea had stood out to me:

> A Markdown Editor 

It was such a simple concept and yet it was something I was in need of because maintaining a blog in an editor like 
Visual Studio Code, whilst workable, never felt seamless **and** I also begun taking notes in markdown, and the 
lack of customization that the Markdown to PDF extension Visual Studio Code had was insufficient. As such, I embarked
on my journey to write my own markdown editor.

I've begun working on it and it's proven to be a lot more challenging than I expected and that's incredibly refreshing!

### Technology Stack
For this project, I'll be using the following technologies:

1. Kotlin
2. TornadoFX
3. RichTextFX
4. FontAwesomeFX
5. Reactive (?)

### Conclusion
This is just a short post about where I'm at and I'm incredibly excited to have a project that I'm genuinely interested
in and learning from!
