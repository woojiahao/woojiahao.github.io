title: "Experience conducting a workshop for Kotlin"
---
During the school holidays, I was fortunate to be able to work with a lecturer from my school to hold a workshop 
teaching Kotlin using Android development as a tool. This was an incredibly interesting and refreshing experience, 
getting to see Year 1 students learning about a language I was passionate about learning myself.

## Planning the workshop
The most difficult part about the talk was to convey my knowledge in the subject to a group of relatively new
programmers. This made it especially interesting as I did not want to just feed them knowledge whilst they stare 
blankly at me, so in the end, I came up with a sample project for them to follow along as well as made use of a set of
documentation sites for anyone else who was interested in the tutorial to just follow along.

## KotlinToDo
In the end, the final idea that I came up with was to simply have the audience follow along as I created a simple to-do
application for Android which had the ability to connect to Firebase's real-time database and serve information to the
user.

This project, whilst being relatively simple, really seemed like a good way to introduce beginners to not only Kotlin
but also fundamental software design concepts that they might have missed in class.

The project came along with a set of elaborate documentation that I had spent weeks working on in order to ensure they 
were easy to work with.

## Difficulties encountered
When it came to the actual talk, the biggest hurdle that I did not anticipate to run into was simply the difference in
level of experience amongst the audience. Some members were new programmers who only just begun 6 months ago, whilst 
others had 18 years of experience. This made it so when I was explaining various concepts, I always had to keep in the 
back of my mind whether the way I explained the concept was easily understood by the beginners and did not bore the 
more experienced individuals.

This was a unique problem I had faced as it was the first time I was teaching such a large group of people and it was 
most certainly something I had little to no experience in. Going through this talk really taught me how to articulate
my thoughts and to deliver the concepts I had in my head to others out loud.

## Rewarding
We did not manage to cover everything I had intended to go through, but at the end of the day, it was really about
encouraging these attendees to be inquisitive and to enjoy the process of software development, which is something I
enjoy a lot.

At the end of the day, I felt happy that I managed to pull off such a workshop as my first time and I am incredibly 
grateful to my lecturers and the attendees for signing up and sitting through this off discovery of mine.

## Conclusion
Overall, this workshop was an eye-opening experience and it really made me develop a much greater sense of appreciation
for the lecturers of my school as I have never experienced what they might experience teaching everyday to even larger
audiences. 

I also managed to grow a lot both as an individual, as I honed my communication skills and teaching abilities.
