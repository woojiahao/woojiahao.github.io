title: "Concluding the National Data Science Challenge 2019"
---

Recently, I participated in the [National Data Science Challenge](https://careers.shopee.sg/ndsc/) organized by Shopee!

It was an incredibly inspiring and exhilarating experience as I worked with my team members to create a solution that 
we could be proud of.

Being able to create a CLI and find ways to analyse large sets of data deepened my experience as a developer and taught
me to approach problems in a different ways. 

Thank you to Mr Lim, Zheng Guang and Feng Yue for accompanying me on this journey!
