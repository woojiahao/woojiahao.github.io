title: "Interning at MightyAim - the good, the bad and the ugly"
---
From February 2018 to April 2018, I interned at the accessibility company [MightyAim](http://mightyaim.co/). When I joined, I was assigned to complete the basic Android framework. There was no one on the Android team, so I was left to my own vices to create this framework. 

## The Good
I really enjoyed working for MightyAim, it was a fun experience and I got to learn a lot about programming and Android development, specifically, making custom gestures and understanding fragments. It had taught me a lot about being an effective developer, as well as learning to cherish teammates since there was no one else on the team to help me out. 

However, in that same regard, I learnt to become more independant. Rather than relying on others all the time, I had to figure everything out from scratch. And that had really made me feel a greater sense of accomplishment.

The boss was also very accepting and had a very flexible working schedule and this made it tremendously easy to voice any concerns with the framework and it allowed me to be a lot more relaxed.

## The Bad
There were some points because I had no one else to rely on, it made it difficult to find solutions to problems. This has most definitely made me experience Imposter's Syndrome as I was stuck in this rut that I couldn't get out of and continually felt that I wasn't good enough.

However, when I took a step back, tried doing other things before coming back to the problem at hand, and I was able to think of better, more efficient solutions to the same problem.

## The Ugly (well, sort of...)
Whilst there were plenty of good things about working at MightyAim, like most companies, there will be flaws. The biggest one I had observed was the lack of proper organization I felt was present when first tasked to make the framework. Many of the decisions previously made seemed impromptu. 

However, airing my concerns with the boss had most definitely enabled me to keep on track.

## Overall
In conclusion, I enjoyed my first internship (as well as my first job ever) at MightyAim. It was a terrific learning experience and they have a genuine mission which I truly believe is worth any effort and struggle I had put in.
